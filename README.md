# Terminal-Maze-Solver
Description : 🐍 This Python project takes you on a maze adventure, blending generation and solving with a dash of depth-first search magic. The script crafts dynamic mazes, complete with randomized walls, start ('S'), and end ('E') points. The find_path function embarks on a recursive journey, paving its way through potential routes and marking the successful path with '•' symbols. Modular and readable, the script offers distinct functions for maze generation, solving, and visual representation. Users can playfully engage, inputting maze sizes to witness the generation and cheer for the script's solution attempt. Successful paths are spotlighted with visual flair, while notices gracefully handle cases where no viable path emerges. 🌐🎮

This project encapsulates algorithmic problem-solving, transforming the maze-solving experience into an interactive Python adventure. So, whether it's watching mazes unfold or celebrating successful solutions, this script invites users to embark on a visual and algorithmic journey. 🚀🧩
